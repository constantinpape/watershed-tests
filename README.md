# Watersheds

Bundling different watershed examples for neuro-segmentation.
Implemented:

* Watershed on distance transform (ws_distance_transform, ws_distance_transform_stacked_2d)
* Watershed on grayscale distance transform (ws_grayscale_distance_transform, ws_grayscale_distance_transform_stacked_2d)
* Watershed on anisotropic distance transform (ws_anisotropic_distance_transform)

## Installation

Install via conda (needs ilastik and conda-forge as additional channels):

```
$ conda install -c cpape watersheds
```
